# Project AI

This repository contains several advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) projects, focusing on **NLP model fine-tuning, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) applied for inbalenced Datasets (R-GANs technics), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation, autonomous agents, and more**.

Each project is organized into a dedicated branch, allowing for modular development and efficient contribution management.
